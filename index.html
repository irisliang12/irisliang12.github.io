					  <figcaption style = "font-weight: 200; font-size: 85%; letter-spacing: 0.4px; word-spacing: 0.6px;">Born in a historic city in northern Jiangsu, I grew up beside Yunlong Lake, accompanied by willow trees and water lilies. Without the fast-paced lifestyle of major cities, Xuzhou has tightly-knit communities and a stronger bond to traditional culture. Whenever I taste the laomo (local cuisine) made by my grandma, bike around the city with my grandpa, or wander by the lake, I truly feel that though I return there with new experiences and perspectives each time, the city will always be an integral part of me. </figcaption>

					  <figcaption style = "font-weight: 200; font-size: 85%; letter-spacing: 0.4px; word-spacing: 0.6px;">At the age of ten, I moved here with my parents. It was my first time living abroad, in a big city, and in an English-speaking environment. However, I quickly discovered the beauties of Vancouver (even the weather since the sound of rain has a de-stressing effect on me). My favorite memories include going on roller coaster rides at Playland, exploring different restaurants downtown, and more recently — jogging along the shore at dusk. I feel pretty glad that I’m stuck here rather than anywhere else at the moment! </figcaption>

					  <figcaption style = "font-weight: 200; font-size: 85%; letter-spacing: 0.4px; word-spacing: 0.6px;">A southeastern city known for tobacco, tech, and Duke, Durham turned out to be much more vibrant than I had expected. I enjoyed living in the vast forest that Duke is built in and exploring the rest of the city in my free time. My only source of complaint is the weather. The morning can be cold enough for a thick sweater and by lunchtime, it has become warm enough for just a T-shirt. On the bright side, this helped me develop a habit of checking the weather forecast first thing in the morning. </figcaption>

			<h6 style="font-size: 180%; font-weight: 100;">In my free time, I like to</h6>

			<h8> Read</h8>
			<p>I especially enjoy reading mystery novels and non-fiction. My favorite authors include Agatha Christie, Jin Yong, Oscar Wilde, Iris Chang, and Keigo Higashimo. Some of the books I've read recently are "When Breath Becomes Air", "The Rape of Nanking", and "Educated". Add me on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101807461-iris-l" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> to see what other books I've been reading.</p>
			<br><h8> Listen to music</h8>
			<p>Music is the most effective stress reliever for me, so I spend a lot of time (perhaps too much time) on this hobby. I also enjoy playing songs I like on the guitar, singing karaoke, and watching hip-hop TV shows. My favorite artists are Jay Chou (jiemi since 2010), Taylor Swift (Swiftie since 2012), and BTS (ARMY since 2019). Other artists I often listen to include Troye Sivan, Sasha Sloan, Jannabi, Sam Kim, and Changmo.</p>  
			<br><h8> Exercise</h8>
			<p>I've tried a variety of sports and enjoy playing badminton, swimming, and jogging the most. In elementary school, I was on the volleyball and basketball teams for 2 years. In high school, I joined the swim team for 3 years and had private badminton training for 2 years. Since the onset of the pandemic, I've developed a habit of jogging, usually for 5 km each day.</p>
			<br><h8> Take photos</h8>
			<p>This explains why my phone is always running out of storage. The subject of my photos is usually food, nature, a friend, or my mom. Follow me on <a href="https://vsco.co/irislg12/gallery" target="_blank">VSCO</a> to see some of the pictures I've taken.</p>
			<br><h8> Travel</h8>
			<p>I really really really like to travel. I keep a list of the places I've visted and another list of the places I want to revisit or visit for the first time in the future. My favorite cities include LA, Seoul, Hangzhou, and Washington DC. Boston, Paris, and New Zealand are my top 3 travel destinations when the pandemic is over.  </p>
			<br><h8> Learn new languages</h8>
			<p>I'm most familiar with Chinese - my native language - and English. I also learned French for 7 years and started learning Korean last year.</p>
			<br><h8> Watch movies/TV shows</h8>
			<p>My favorite genres are mystery, science fiction, fantasy, and thriller. Some of my favorites are "Identity", "Dead Poets Society", "The Pursuit of Happyness", and (almost) all Marvel movies. As for TV shows, I like "Signal", "Reply 1988", "Westworld", "Nirvana in Fire", and "Sherlock" the most.</p>
